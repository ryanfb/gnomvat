# Introduction

The material collected, edited, and translated here from [Codex *Vaticanus Graecus* 743](https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.gr.743) aims to provide the reader with a foothold on this small corner of the vast and confusing edifice of ancient wisdom literature. The primary point of entry is the so-called "Gnomologium Vaticanum", contained in folios 6r-46v of *Vat.Gr.* 743, first edited and published by Leo Sternbach starting in 1887. This is a collection of 577 sayings arranged in first-letter alphabetical order by author, with the final 14 sayings at the end reserved for "sayings of women". This material has significant overlaps with other gnomologia, but is also the sole witness for some of the sayings it records.

In order to understand this material better, I believe it is best first situated in its manuscript context. *Vat.Gr.* 743 contains 106 folios of text by four different hands, which we can separate into nine distinct sections of text:

1. **1r-3v** (hand 1)

   59 parables of "Demophilus", edited and published by Friedrich Wilhelm August Mullach in [*Fragmenta philosophorum Graecorum* I (1860), pp.485-487](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_d7sNAAAAYAAJ/). These also have significant overlap with the sententiae edited and published by Anton Elter as "Sententiae Pythagoreorum (fort. auctore vel collectore Demophilo)" in *Gnomica homoeomata* (1900-1904), on which see also **46v-52v** below. In the present MS this bears the title "Δημοφίλου έκ τῶν Πυθαγορείων ὅμοια ἢ βίου θεραπεία"/"Demophilean parables from the Pythagoreans, or the cultivation of life", following Mullach's edition up through the termination of the last entry, with no indication of a break in the material before proceeding to the first entry of the next section (that is, there is no "Τέλος τῶν Δημοφίλου ὁμοίων"/"End of the Demophilean parables" in the manuscript, and no title of "Δημοφίλου Γνώμαι Πυθαγορικαἰ"/"Pythagorean Gnomoi of Demophilus" beginning the next section).

2. **3v-6r** (hand 1)

   45 sayings of "Demophilus" in first-letter alphabetical order, edited by Mullach, op. cit., pp.497-499. These represent a subset of a larger collection of 123 sayings published as "The Pythagorean Sentences" by H. Chadwick (in *The Sentences of Sextus* (1959), pp.84-94), on which more below. Again, no break or end (i.e. Mullach's "Τἐλος τῶν τοῦ Δεμοφίλου γνωμῶν"/"End of the Demophilean gnomoi") is indicated in the manuscript before proceeding directly to the first entry of the next section.
   
3. **6r-46v** (hand 1)

   577 sayings comprising the "Gnomologium Vaticanum", edited and published by Sternbach. This section begins simply with the first entry starting in the manuscript as "Ἀντισθένους: Ὁ αὐτὸς τοὺς πόνους ἔφησεν…"/"Antisthenes': The same person said that tasks…". The final 14 entries have the manuscript division "Αποφθέγματα γυναικῶν, ἤτοι φρονήματα"/"Apothegms of women, or their thoughts" (45v), with the last entry edited by Sternbach running into the material below with the manuscript heading "Πλουτάρχου γνῶμοι"/"Plutarchean gnomoi" (46v).

4. **46v-52v** (hand 1)

   "Plutarchean" gnomoi, edited and published by Anton Elter as "Sententiae Pythagoreorum (fort. auctore vel collectore Demophilo)" in *Gnomica homoeomata* (1900-1904).

5. **52v-56v** (hand 1)

   Apothegms of seven philosophers in a numbered list, edited and published by Mullach as "Apothegms of the seven wise men by Demetrius of Phalerum" (op. cit. pp.212-218), later edited and published by H. Diels and W. Kranz in *Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker*, vol. 1, 6th edn. (1951), pp.63-66. These are translated into English by William W. Fortenbaugh and Eckart Schütrumpf in "Demetrius of Phalerum: Text, Translation and Discussion", *Rutgers University Studies in Classical Humanities* 9 (2017), pp.154-165. Again, no title in the manuscript divides this from the previous section, it begins simply with "Φιλοσόφων α’: Κλεόβουλος Εὐαγόρου Λίνδιος ἔφη"/"Belonging to philosopher 1: Cleobolus son of Euagoras of Lindos said".

6. **57r-90v** (hand 1 & 2)

   [So-called "Sibylline Oracles"](https://www.nasscal.com/e-clavis-christian-apocrypha/sibylline-oracles/), starting with book 6, but also containing 4 & 7-9. These have been edited by Johannes Geffcken as [*Die Oracula Sibyllina* (1902)](https://archive.org/details/dieoraculasibyl00geffgoog) and translated into English by J.J. Collins in Charlesworth's *The Old Testament Pseudegpigrapha* I (1983), pp.317-472.

7. **91r-97v** (hand 3)

   The so-called "Paradeisos" attributed to "John Geometres". This material was last edited and published in 1820 by Xavier Werfer (["Nili Ascetae Paraenetica e Codicibus Darmstadiensi et Bernensi. Opus posthumum," *Acta Philologorum Monacensium* 3 (1820), pp.61-118](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112023739250?urlappend=%3Bseq=75%3Bownerid=13510798903509760-99)), but is sorely in need of a new edition, as Kristoffel Demoen notes (in ["*Metaphrasis* and Versification: The *Paradeisos* as a Reworking of *Apophthegmata Patrum*", *The Medieval Mediterranean* 125 (2020), pp.202-223](http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-8680765)). Aside from the selected translations by Demoen, I'm not aware of any translations of this work. Björn Isebaert's 2004 dissertation (*De Παράδεισος van Ioannes Kuriotes Geometres (?): Kritische tekst met inleiding en commentaar*) includes a new critical edition, but remains unpublished. According to Demoen (2020): "A co-authored monograph (Demoen – Isebaert) on the *Paradeisos*, including a revised and updated version of this critical text, is currently under preparation. Our new critical text will deviate from the previous ones in about 90 of the 99 poems, often crucially."

8. **98r-102v** (hand 4)

   Eighteen poems attributed to John Geometres. These were edited, translated into French, and published by Emilie Marlène van Opstall as "Jean Géomètre: Poèmes en hexamètres et en distiques élégiaques. Editions, traduction, commentaire", *The Medieval Mediterranean* 75 (2008). The eighteen poems in the present MS are poems 53-65, 67, 68, 72, 75, 76, and 81 in Opstall's enumeration. 

9. **102r-106v** (hand 4)

   Seven anonymous poems, edited and translated by Nikos Zagklas in ["Astrology, piety and poverty: seven anonymous poems in Vaticanus gr. 743", *Byzantinische Zeitschrift*, vol. 109, no. 2 (2016), pp. 895-918](https://doi.org/10.1515/bz-2016-0025).
