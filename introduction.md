# Introduction

The material collected, edited, and translated here from [Codex *Vaticanus Graecus* 743](https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.gr.743) aims to provide the reader with a foothold on this small corner of the vast and confusing edifice of ancient wisdom literature. The primary point of entry is the so-called "Gnomologium Vaticanum", contained in folios 6r-46v of *Vat.Gr.* 743, first edited and published by Leo Sternbach starting in 1887. This is a collection of 577 sayings arranged in first-letter alphabetical order by author, with the final 14 sayings at the end reserved for "sayings of women". This material has significant overlaps with other gnomologia, but is also the sole witness for some of the sayings it records.

In order to understand this material better, I believe it is best first situated in its manuscript context. *Vat.Gr.* 743 contains 106 folios of text by four different hands, which we can separate into nine distinct sections of text:

1. **1r-3v** (hand 1)

   Parables of "Demophilus", edited and published by Friedrich Wilhelm August Mullach in [*Fragmenta philosophorum Graecorum* I (1860), pp.485-487](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_d7sNAAAAYAAJ/).

2. **3v-6r** (hand 1)

   Sayings of "Demophilus", ibid., pp.497-499.
   
3. **6r-46v** (hand 1)

   The "Gnomologium Vaticanum", edited and published by Sternbach.

4. **46v-52v** (hand 1)

   "Plutarchean" gnomoi, edited and published by Anton Elter as *Gnomica homoeomata* (1900-1904).

5. **52v-56v** (hand 1)

   "Gnomica Varia", edited and published by Mullach as apothegms of Demetrius of Phalerum (pp.212-218).

6. **57r-90v** (hand 1 & 2)

   So-called "Sibylline Oracles", starting with book 6, but also containing 4 & 7-9. These have been edited by Johannes Geffcken as [*Die Oracula Sibyllina* (1902)](https://archive.org/details/dieoraculasibyl00geffgoog) and translated into English by J.J. Collins in Charlesworth's *The Old Testament Pseudegpigrapha* I (1983), pp.317-472.

7. **91r-97v** (hand 3)

   The so-called "Paradeisos" attributed to "John Geometres". This material was last edited and published in 1820 by Xavier Werfer (["Nili Ascetae Paraenetica e Codicibus Darmstadiensi et Bernensi. Opus posthumum," *Acta Philologorum Monacensium* 3 (1820), pp.61-118](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112023739250?urlappend=%3Bseq=75%3Bownerid=13510798903509760-99)), but is sorely in need of a new edition, as Kristoffel Demoen notes (in ["*Metaphrasis* and Versification: The *Paradeisos* as a Reworking of *Apophthegmata Patrum*", *The Medieval Mediterranean* 125 (2020), pp.202-223](http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-8680765)). Aside from the selected translations by Demoen, I'm not aware of any translations of this work. Björn Isebaert's 2004 dissertation (*De Παράδεισος van Ioannes Kuriotes Geometres (?): Kritische tekst met inleiding en commentaar*) includes a new critical edition, but remains unpublished. According to Demoen: "A co-authored monograph (Demoen – Isebaert) on the *Paradeisos*, including a revised and updated version of this critical text, is currently under preparation. Our new critical text will deviate from the previous ones in about 90 of the 99 poems, often crucially."

8. **98r-102v** (hand 4)

   Eighteen poems attributed to John Geometres. These were edited, translated into French, and published by Emilie Marlène van Opstall as "Jean Géomètre: Poèmes en hexamètres et en distiques élégiaques. Editions, traduction, commentaire", *The Medieval Mediterranean* 75 (2008), pp.108-114. The eighteen poems in the present MS are poems 53-65, 67, 68, 72, 75, 76, and 81 in Opstall's enumeration. 

9. **102r-106v** (hand 4)

   Seven anonymous poems, edited and translated by Nikos Zagklas in ["Astrology, piety and poverty: seven anonymous poems in Vaticanus gr. 743", *Byzantinische Zeitschrift*, vol. 109, no. 2 (2016), pp. 895-918](https://doi.org/10.1515/bz-2016-0025).
