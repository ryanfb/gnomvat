   \[Antisthenes\] was asked by someone, how the government of a city should be approached, he said: “not too close, so that you won’t get burned, but not too far either, so that you won’t freeze.”

    \[Anacharsis\] was playing knucklebones, and being rebuked on account of his playing, said: “Just as a bow stretched too far breaks, but one relaxed, becomes useful to the matters of life, thus also we should treat the reasoning which remains toiling upon itself.”

    Aristippus the Cyrenian philosopher was shipwrecked sailing into Athens, and having been taken in by the Athenians and asked what he intended after returning to Cyrene to say to his friends back home, said: “to procure the sorts of travel provisions, which will float together with the shipwreck.”

24. Ὁ αὐτὸς παρὰ τῶν μαθητῶν λαμβάνειν ἔφασκε μισθόν, οὐχ ὅπως τὸν βίον ἐπανορθώσῃ, ἀλλ’ ὅπως ἐκεῖνοι μάθωσιν εἰς τὰ καλὰ δαπανᾶν.

    \[Aristippus\] said he took a fee from his students, not to correct their life, but so that they would learn that they can put their money towards fine things.
    
25. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἄσωτον γενόμενον τὸν υἱὸν ἐξέκλεισεν· τῆς δὲ γυναικὸς μεμφομένης, ὅτι αὐτὸν οὐ προσίεται καὶ λεγούσης παρ’ ἕκαστα, ὡς καὶ οὗτος ἐξ αὐτοῦ εἴη, ἀποπτύσας \[ὁ Ἀρίστιππος\] \<ἔφη·\> „καὶ γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο ἐξ ἐμοῦ ἐστιν, ἀλλ’ ἀποῤῥίπτω αὐτό, ὅτι με λυπεῖ“.

    \[Aristippus\] shut out his son because he became profligate. But when his wife reproached him because he did not admit him and  said each time that this man also was from him, Aristippus, spitting, said, "No, for this also is from me, but I get rid of it because it pains me."

26. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτώμενος, τί θαυμαστόν ἐστιν ἐν βίῳ \<εἶπεν\>· „ἄνθρωπος ἐπιεικὴς καὶ μέτριος, ὅτι ἐν πολλοῖς ὑπάρχων μοχθηροῖς οὐ διέστραπται“.

    \[Aristippus\] being asked, what is amazing in life, said: “a person who is fair and moderate, since being among many wretched leaders they were unable to be twisted.”
    
27. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἀνθρώπου αὐτὸν ἀδικήσαντος καὶ περιφεύγοντος καὶ ἀπαντᾶν διατρεπομένου συντυχὼν ἅπαξ εἶπεν· „οὐ σὲ χρὴ ἐμὲ φεύγειν, ἀλλ’ ἐμὲ σὲ ὄντα φαῦλον“. 

    \[Aristippus\] having happened upon a man who was unjust and hiding from him and altogether in the wrong, once said: “You don’t need to hide from me, but me from your being so low.”

    \[Aristippus\] was being being reproached by someone, that the Cyrenian leaders had banished him from their homeland, and said: “Yes, young man! My homeland did a great wrong in casting me out of Libya and into Greece.”

30. Ὁ αὐτὸς Πλάτωνος εἰσελθόντος πρὸς αὐτὸν μαλακῶς ἔχοντα καὶ πυθομένου, πῶς διάγει, ἔφη τὸν μὲν σπουδαῖον καὶ πυρέττοντα καλῶς ἔχειν, τὸν δὲ φαῦλον καὶ μὴ πυρέττοντα κακῶς.

    Once, Plato approached \[Aristippus\] when he had a fever and asked, “How are you?”, and he said: “Those who are good and feverish are well, but those who are bad and feverless are ill.”
    
31. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐγκαλοῦντός τινος ἀνθρώπῳ τινί, ὅτι λαβὼν ἀργύριον οὐκ ἀπέδωκε, „σαυτῷ δέ“, φησίν, „οὐκ ἐγκαλεῖς, εἰ μὴ ὀρθῶς ἐδοκίμασας, ᾧ ἐδίδους;“

    \[Aristippus\] on being accused by someone, that he took money and didn’t give it back, said: “Are you not accused by yourself, if you didn’t choose rightly, o giver?”

32. Ὁ αὐτὸς καθόλου τὸ εὔχεσθαι τὰ ἀγαθὰ καὶ ἀπαιτεῖν τι παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἔφη γελοῖον εἶναι· οὐ γὰρ τοὺς ἰατροὺς ὅταν ἄῤῥωστος αἰτῇ τι βρωτὸν ἢ ποτόν, τότε διδόναι, ἀλλ’ ὅταν αὐτοῖς δοκήσῃ συμφέρειν.

    \[Aristippus\] said that to pray for something good and demand it from god is generally laughable; for doctors do not give the sick food or drink whenever they ask for it, but whenever they think it will help them.
    
33. Ὁ αὐτὸς ὁρκίζοντός τινος παῖδα χρηστὸν γενέσθαι καὶ δίκαιον εἰς αὐτὸν εἶπεν· „ὅρκωσον αὐτὸν καὶ γραμματικὸν καὶ μουσικὸν γενέσθαι καὶ ὅρα, εἰ ἔσται μηδὲν μαθὼν τῶν τοιούτων“.

    \[Aristippus\], when an enslaved person was swearing to become good and just, said: "Swear to become a grammarian and musician and see, if you ever learn these things."

    \[Aristippus\] said: "Just as our bodies are grown by nourishment, but strengthened by exercise, thus also the soul is grown by thinking, but becomes better by patience."

35. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπὸ Διονυσίου τοῦ τυράννου, πότε παύσεται αἰτῶν αὐτόν, „ὅτε“, ἔφη, „καὶ σὺ διδούς· τοῦτο δὲ ἔσται, ὅταν μὴ εὐαρεστήσωμεν ἀλλήλοις“.

    \[Aristippus\] having been asked by the tyrant Dionysius, when he would stop begging, said: "Whenever you also stop giving; but you'll be able to do this, when we're not pleasing to one another."

     \[Theocritus\] was at a drinking party where certain young men were quarreling with each other over what was the most pleasant water of all those in the world (but dinner was not being served), with some of them saying it was the water in Corinth from Pirene, others saying the water in Pieria from Helicon, and others saying the water in Chalcis from Arethousa. Then, when they asked him which he agreed with, he said, "I think at the present moment that the best water is the one for washing hands."

340. Ὁ αὐτὸς τῶν Χίων οὐκ ἐώντων αὐτὸν στῆσαι τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ πρὸς τῇ στοᾷ, ἀλλὰ φασκόντων τοὺς ὀλυμπιονίκας ἐκεῖ δεῖν ἵστασθαι, ἔφη· „ἐὰν Ὀλύμπιά τις ὑμῶν νικήσῃ, μετάθετέ μου τὴν εἰκόνα εἰς τὴν ταριχόπωλιν“.

     When \[Theocritus\] was invited to the symposium of a profligate man who, having sold his own land, had devoured it up, and when that man brought forward boiling food and claimed that he had burnt down the sky, he said, "Well then, if you have devoured up the land and burnt down the sky, the only remaining thing for you is the drink up the sea."

     \[Theocritus\], when the Abderites were deliberating how they would conquer the Thracians, said, "If you elect Charmides the doctor as general, you will command the one who is now serving as general to be a doctor.
