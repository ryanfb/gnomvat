   \[Antisthenes\] was asked by a tyrant, why the rich don’t seek out the wise, but instead the opposite happens, he said: “The wise know what things they need in life, but the rich do not know, since they consider things better than wisdom.”
   
7. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπό τινος, τί· τὸν υἱὸν διδάξει, εἶπεν· „εἰ μὲν θεοῖς αὐτὸν συμβιοῦν ἐθέλοις, φιλόσοφον· εἰ δὲ ἀνθρώποις, ῥήτορα“.

   \[Antisthenes\] was asked by someone, how the government of a city should be approached, he said: “not too close, so that you won’t get burned, but not too far either, so that you won’t freeze.”

    \[Anacharsis\] being rebuked by an Athenian on account of a solecism said: “Anacharsis solecises according to Athenians, Athenians according to Anacharsis.”

17. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἀστραγαλίζων καὶ ἐπιτιμηθείς, διότι παίζει, ἔφη· „ὥσπερ τὰ τόξα διὰ παντὸς τεταμένα ῥήσσεται, ἐπὰν δὲ ἀνεθῇ, εὔχρηστα γίνεται πρὸς τὰς ἐν τῷ βίῳ χρείας, οὕτω καὶ ὁ λογισμὸς ἐπὶ τῶν αὐτῶν μένων κάμνει“.

    \[Anacharsis\] was playing knucklebones, and being rebuked on account of his playing, said: “Just as a bow stretched too far breaks, but one relaxed, becomes useful to the matters of life, thus also we should treat the reasoning which remains toiling upon itself.”

    \[Anacharsis\] being reproached by someone, on account of being Scythian, said: “The rose too is grown in thorns, but in pleasure and beauty distinguishes itself.”

23. Ἀρίστιππος, ὁ Κυρηναῖος φιλόσοφος, πλέων εἰς Ἀθήνας ἐναυάγησεν καὶ ὑποληφθεὶς ὑπ’ Ἀθηναίων ὡς ἠρωτήθη, τί μέλλει εἰς Κυρήνην ἐπανελθὼν λέγειν πρὸς τοὺς οἰκείους, ἔφη· „τοιαῦτα ἐφόδια κτᾶσθαι, ἃ καὶ ναυαγοῦσι συν\<εκ\>νήχεται“.

    Aristippus the Cyrenian philosopher was shipwrecked sailing into Athens, and having been taken in by the Athenians and asked what he intended after returning to Cyrene to say to his friends back home, said: “to procure the sorts of travel provisions, which will float together with the shipwreck.”

24. Ὁ αὐτὸς παρὰ τῶν μαθητῶν λαμβάνειν ἔφασκε μισθόν, οὐχ ὅπως τὸν βίον ἐπανορθώσῃ, ἀλλ’ ὅπως ἐκεῖνοι μάθωσιν εἰς τὰ καλὰ δαπανᾶν.

    \[Aristippus\] said he took a fee from his students, not to correct their life, but so that they would learn that they can put their money towards fine things.
    
25. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἄσωτον γενόμενον τὸν υἱὸν ἐξέκλεισεν· τῆς δὲ γυναικὸς μεμφομένης, ὅτι αὐτὸν οὐ προσίεται καὶ λεγούσης παρ’ ἕκαστα, ὡς καὶ οὗτος ἐξ αὐτοῦ εἴη, ἀποπτύσας \[ὁ Ἀρίστιππος\] \<ἔφη·\> „καὶ γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο ἐξ ἐμοῦ ἐστιν, ἀλλ’ ἀποῤῥίπτω αὐτό, ὅτι με λυπεῖ“.

    \[Aristippus\] shut out his son because he became profligate. But when his wife reproached him because he did not admit him and  said each time that this man also was from him, Aristippus, spitting, said, "No, for this also is from me, but I get rid of it because it pains me."

26. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτώμενος, τί θαυμαστόν ἐστιν ἐν βίῳ \<εἶπεν\>· „ἄνθρωπος ἐπιεικὴς καὶ μέτριος, ὅτι ἐν πολλοῖς ὑπάρχων μοχθηροῖς οὐ διέστραπται“.

    \[Aristippus\] being asked, what is amazing in life, said: “a person who is fair and moderate, since being among many wretched leaders they were unable to be twisted.”
    
27. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἀνθρώπου αὐτὸν ἀδικήσαντος καὶ περιφεύγοντος καὶ ἀπαντᾶν διατρεπομένου συντυχὼν ἅπαξ εἶπεν· „οὐ σὲ χρὴ ἐμὲ φεύγειν, ἀλλ’ ἐμὲ σὲ ὄντα φαῦλον“. 

    \[Aristippus\] having happened upon a man who was unjust and hiding from him and altogether in the wrong, once said: “You don’t need to hide from me, but me from your being so low.”
    
28. Ὁ αὐτὸς ὀνειδιζόμενος ὑπό τινος, ὅτι Κυρηναῖος ὑπάρχων ἐκ τῆς πατρίδος πεφυγάδευται, „καί“, εἶπε, „νεανίσκε, μεγάλα με ἡ πατρὶς ἠδίκησεν ἐκ τῆς Λιβύης με εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἐκβαλοῦσα“.

    \[Aristippus\] was being being reproached by someone, that the Cyrenian leaders had banished him from their homeland, and said: “Yes, young man! My homeland did a great wrong in casting me out of Libya and into Greece.”
    
29. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη δεῖν ἐθίζειν ἀπὸ ὀλίγων ζῆν, ἵνα μηδὲν αἰσχρὸν χρημάτων ἕνεκεν πράττωμεν.

    \[Aristippus\] said that it was necessary to be used to living with little, so that we might not do anything shameful on account of money.

30. Ὁ αὐτὸς Πλάτωνος εἰσελθόντος πρὸς αὐτὸν μαλακῶς ἔχοντα καὶ πυθομένου, πῶς διάγει, ἔφη τὸν μὲν σπουδαῖον καὶ πυρέττοντα καλῶς ἔχειν, τὸν δὲ φαῦλον καὶ μὴ πυρέττοντα κακῶς.

    Once, Plato approached \[Aristippus\] when he had a fever and asked, “How are you?”, and he said: “Those who are good and feverish are well, but those who are bad and feverless are ill.”
    
31. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐγκαλοῦντός τινος ἀνθρώπῳ τινί, ὅτι λαβὼν ἀργύριον οὐκ ἀπέδωκε, „σαυτῷ δέ“, φησίν, „οὐκ ἐγκαλεῖς, εἰ μὴ ὀρθῶς ἐδοκίμασας, ᾧ ἐδίδους;“

    \[Aristippus\] on being accused by someone, that he took money and didn’t give it back, said: “Are you not accused by yourself, if you didn’t choose rightly, o giver?”

32. Ὁ αὐτὸς καθόλου τὸ εὔχεσθαι τὰ ἀγαθὰ καὶ ἀπαιτεῖν τι παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἔφη γελοῖον εἶναι· οὐ γὰρ τοὺς ἰατροὺς ὅταν ἄῤῥωστος αἰτῇ τι βρωτὸν ἢ ποτόν, τότε διδόναι, ἀλλ’ ὅταν αὐτοῖς δοκήσῃ συμφέρειν.

    \[Aristippus\] said that to pray for something good and demand it from god is generally laughable; for doctors do not give the sick food or drink whenever they ask for it, but whenever they think it will help them.
    
33. Ὁ αὐτὸς ὁρκίζοντός τινος παῖδα χρηστὸν γενέσθαι καὶ δίκαιον εἰς αὐτὸν εἶπεν· „ὅρκωσον αὐτὸν καὶ γραμματικὸν καὶ μουσικὸν γενέσθαι καὶ ὅρα, εἰ ἔσται μηδὲν μαθὼν τῶν τοιούτων“.

    \[Aristippus\], when an enslaved person was swearing to become good and just, said: "Swear to become a grammarian and musician and see, if you ever learn these things."

34. Ὁ αὐτὸς εἶπεν· „ὥσπερ τὰ σώματα ἡμῶν τρεφόμενα μὲν αὔξεται, γυμναζόμενα δὲ στερεοῦται, οὕτω καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ μελετῶσα μὲν αὔξεται, καρτεροῦσα δὲ βελτίων γίνεται“.

    \[Aristippus\] said: "Just as our bodies are grown by nourishment, but strengthened by exercise, thus also the soul is grown by thinking, but becomes better by patience."

35. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπὸ Διονυσίου τοῦ τυράννου, πότε παύσεται αἰτῶν αὐτόν, „ὅτε“, ἔφη, „καὶ σὺ διδούς· τοῦτο δὲ ἔσται, ὅταν μὴ εὐαρεστήσωμεν ἀλλήλοις“.

    \[Aristippus\] having been asked by the tyrant Dionysius, when he would stop begging, said: "Whenever you also stop giving; but you'll be able to do this, when we're not pleasing to one another."

36. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθείς, τί αὐτῷ περιγέγονεν ἐκ φιλοσοφίας, ἔφη· „τὸ ἀδεῶς τοῖς ἐντυγχάνουσιν ὁμιλεῖν“.

    \[Aristippus\] having been asked, what advantage he'd gained from philosophy, said: "Effortlessly keeping company with anyone I meet."

37. Ὁ αὐτὸς εἰπόντος τινὸς αὐτῷ, διὰ τί τοῖς μοχθηροῖς πλησιάζει, εἶπεν· „ὅτι καὶ ἰατροὶ τοῖς νοσοῦσιν.“

    \[Aristippus\], when someone asked why he associated with bad people, said: "Since doctors also associate with sick people."

38. Ὁ αὐτὸς θεασάμενός τινα ὀργιζόμενον καὶ διὰ τῶν λόγων σφοδρῶς χαλεπαίνοντα ὑποτυχὼν ἔφη· „μὴ τοὺς λόγους δι’ ὀργῆς ἄγωμεν, ἀλλὰ τὴν ὀργὴν διὰ τῶν λόγων καταλύωμεν“.

    \[Aristippus\], seeing someone angry and furious on account of an argument, interrupting him said: "Let us not conduct argument through anger, but instead dissolve anger through argument."

39. Ὁ αὐτὸς οὐκ ὀλίγα χρήματα παρὰ Διονυσίου \[καὶ\] μετὰ τὸν ἀπόπλουν λαβὼν καὶ δι’ αὐτὰ ἐπιβουλεύεσθαι μέλλων ὑπὸ τῶν ναυτῶν, μεταβὰς ἐκ τοῦ μέσου τῆς νηὸς παρ’ ἕνα τοῖχον ἐκέλευσε ἐκκενωθῆναι τὰ ἀγγεῖα ἐπὶ τῶν σανίδων ὡς ἀριθμεῖν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐσπουδακώς, περινεύσας δὲ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸν βυθόν· τῶν δὲ ναυτῶν ἐπὶ τούτῳ δυσφορησάντων εἶπε· "λυσιτελεῖ δι’ ἐμὲ τὸ ἀργύριον ἀπολέσθαι ἢ ἐμὲ δι’ αὐτό."

    \[Aristippus\] had taken a lot of money from Dionysius when sailing back and because of this the sailors were plotting against him, so he moved from the middle of the boat to one side and ordered them to empty the money out onto the benches as though they could immediately count the money, but instead he turned around and threw it into the deep; and with the sailors being furious at this, he said: "Better to lose the money because of me than to lose me because of the money."

40. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐπιλαμβανομένου αὐτοῦ ποτε Πλάτωνος [ἐπὶ] τῶν δώδεκα δραχμῶν πολυτελῆ ἰχθὺν πρίασθαι ἠρώτησεν, εἰ αὐτὸς ἂν δραχμῆς τὸν αὐτὸν ἰχθὺν ὠνήσατο· τοῦ δὲ συνθεμένου ἔφη μηδὲ αὑτῷ πολλοῦ καθεστηκέναι· „ὃ γάρ ἐστι Πλάτωνι ἡ μία δραχμή, τοῦτο Ἀριστίππῳ αἱ δώδεκα.“ 

    When Plato rebuked \[Aristippus\] for trying to buy a fancy fish for 12 drachmae he asked, if \[Plato\] would buy the same fish for a drachma; and when he agreed, \[Aristippus\] said it wouldn't be too great a cost for him, "Since what is one drachma for Plato, is twelve for Aristippus."

41. Ὁ αὐτὸς παρὰ Διονυσίῳ ποτὲ τῷ τυράννῳ γυναικείων ἐσθήτων περιφερομένων ἐν τῷ συμποσίῳ τοῖς βουλομένοις ἐνδύσασθαι καὶ συμπαῖξαι ἡνδήποτε παιδιὰν καὶ τοῦ Πλάτωνος παραιτησαμένου διὰ τοιούτου στίχου·

    > οὐκ ἂν δυναίμην θῆλυν ἐνδῦναι στολὴν 
    
    \[ὁ Ἀρίστιππος\] εἶπεν· δός· 

    > καὶ γὰρ ἐν βακχεύμασιν
    
    > οὖσ’ ἥ γε σώφρων οὐ διαφθαρήσεται.
    
    When \[Aristippus\] was at Dionysius the tyrant's, women's clothes were being passed around in the symposium for those wishing to put them on and play together in some kind of game, and Plato declined with this line of verse:

    > It's not possible for me to put on a woman's garment
    
    \[Aristippus\] said: Yield,

    > For even in Bacchic rituals,
    
    > a woman who is truly self-controlled will not be seduced.

42. Ὁ αὐτὸς μεταπεμπομένου πολλάκις αὐτὸν τοῦ πατρός, ὡς οὐχ ὑπήκουσεν γράψαντος, ὅτι πωλήσει αὐτὸν κατὰ τοὺς πατρίους νόμους, ἀντέγραψεν ὀλίγον ἔτι περιμεῖναι χρόνον· καὶ \<γὰρ\> πλείονος ἄξιον γενόμενον πλείονος πωλήσειν. 

    \[Aristippus\] was being sent for by his father repeatedly, but since he did not obey, his father wrote that he would sell him into slavery in accordance with the parental laws; so Aristippus wrote back to wait a little while longer: for becoming more worthy he would be able to be sold for more.

43. Ὁ αὐτὸς μέλλων ἐντυγχάνειν Φαρναβάζῳ, τῷ βασιλέως σατράπῃ, [καὶ] λέγοντός τινος αὐτῷ· „θάρσει, ὦ Ἀρίστιππε“, ἔφη· „εἴ τι ἕτερον ἔχεις, λέγε· ἐγὼ δὲ, ἐξ οὗ Σωκράτει ὡμίλησα, οὐδενὸς ἀνδρὸς ὁμιλίαν ηὐλαβήθην“.

    \[Aristippus\] was about to meet Pharnabazus, the king's satrap, and someone said to him: "Cheer up, Aristippus!", so he said: "If you have something else to say, say it; for my part, ever since I conversed with Socrates, I haven't been wary of conversing with any other man."

44. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφησεν· „καὶ εἰ μηδὲν ἄλλο, ἐκ φιλοσοφίας τοῦτό μοι περιγέγονε· τὸ τοῖς προσπίπτουσι κατὰ λόγον ὑπαντᾶν.“

    \[Aristippus\] said: "If nothing else, I've gained this from philosophy: to meet the things that befall me rationally."

45. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐπιλαβομένων αὐτοῦ τῶν πολιτῶν, ὅτι μειρακίοις μᾶλλον συνδιατρίβει διαλεγόμενος αὐτοῖς περὶ φρονήσεως, ἔφη· „καὶ γὰρ ὑμᾶς, ὦ πολῖται, ὁρῶ οὐ τοὺς γέροντας τῶν ἵππων δαμάζοντας, ἀλλὰ τοὺς πώλους.“

    \[Aristippus\] having been rebuked by the populace, that he spent more time talking with youths about wisdom than with them, said: "Because, citizens, I don't see you taming the old horses, but the young ones."

46. Ἄλεξις, ὁ τῶν κωμῳδιῶν ποιητής, ἐπειδή τις αὐτὸν ὄντα πρεσβύτην ἑώρα μόλις πορευόμενον καὶ ἠρώτα· „τί ποιεῖς“; „κατὰ σχολήν“, φησίν, „ἀποθνήσκω“.

    Alexis, the comic poet, when someone saw him as an old man walking slowly and asked: "What are you doing?", said: "By slowness, dying."

47. Ἀριστείδης ὁ δίκαιος ὀνειδιζόμενός ποτε ἐπὶ πενίᾳ εἶπεν· „ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ μὲν ἡ πενία οὐδὲν συνιστορεῖ κακόν, σοὶ δὲ ὁ πλοῦτος πολλά“.

    Aristides the Just being reproached when he was in poverty, said: "But my poverty suggests nothing bad, while your wealth suggests much."

48. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἀκούσας, ὅτι τὰς εἰκόνας αὐτοῦ κατέβαλον οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι, „ἀλλ’ οὐ τὴν ἀρετήν,“ ἔφη, „δι’ ἣν ἐκείνας ἀνέστησαν“.

    \[Aristides\], hearing that the Athenians had destroyed the statues of him, said: "But not the virtue they erected them on account of."

49. Ἀριστοτέλης ὁ φιλόσοφος ἰδὼν νέον σπουδάζοντα περὶ τὰς θέας, „ὅρα“, εἶπεν, „ὦ νεανίσκε, μὴ σπουδάζων περὶ τὸ θεᾶσθαι ἑτέρους αὐτὸς μηδὲν ἄξιον σχῇς θέας“.

    Aristotle the philosopher, seeing a young man anxious about getting a view, said, "Watch, o young man, lest, while being anxious about viewing others, you yourself have nothing worthy of a view."
 
50. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη τὴν παιδείαν εὐτυχοῦσι μὲν εἶναι κόσμον, ἀτυχοῦσι δὲ καταφύγιον.

    \[Aristotle\] said that education is an ornament for those faring well, and a refuge for those faring ill.

    \[Aristotle\], seeing someone grieved at the threats of his father, said, "Do not pay heed to his words, young man, but to his heart."

    \[Aristotle\], when someone was rejoicing with him, because he had Alexander as a student, said, "Rejoice with that man, because he has Aristotle as a teacher.

57. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη· μεγάλους χρὴ λαμβάνειν μισθοὺς παρὰ μὲν τῶν εὐφυῶν, ὅτι πολλὰ ὠφελοῦνται, παρὰ δὲ τῶν ἀφυῶν, ὅτι πολλὰ πράγματα μανθάνοντες παρέχουσι τοῖς διδάσκουσιν

     \[Diogenes\], when Polyxenus the dialectician was angry because some people were calling him a dog, said, "You, call me a dog, too. For Diogenes is my nickname. But I am a dog, however, one of the noble ones and those that protect their friends."

202. Ὁ αὐτὸς παραινοῦντός τινος αὐτῷ τῶν φίλων ἤδη ὄντι ἐν γήρᾳ κἂν νῦν προσανεῖναι διὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν ὅμοιον ἔφη εἶναι, ὡς εἰ ἀγωνιζομένῳ αὐτῷ δρόμον καὶ ἤδη ἐγγίζοντι τῷ βραβείῳ προσανεῖναι τὸ τάχος παρεκελεύετο, ὅτε ἔδει τοὐναντίον ἐπιτεῖναι παραινεῖν.

     \[Diogenes\], when one of his friends was advising him, since he was now in old age, to slacken now at any rate due to his time of life, said that it was the same thing, as if he was encouraging him while competing in a race and drawing close to the prize to slacken his speed, when he should be advising the opposite, to incite him.

203. Δημοσθένης ὁ ῥήτωρ τὸν οἶνον παρῃτεῖτο οὐ ψυχῆς ὄντα πόμα, ἀλλὰ σώματος, ἵνα τε ξυνιέναι ὀξύτερος ᾖ καὶ ἀμείνων μνημονεύς.

     \[Demosthenes\], when some young man, beautiful in appearance but wanton in his way of life, was reproaching him and saying that, if he was hated by the citizens as much as he was, he would have been strangled, said, "So would I have been strangled, \<if\> I were loved as much as you are by the citizens."
 
215. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἑξηκονταετοῦς τινος εἰπόντος μηδεπώποτε οὕτως ἀσθενῆσαι ἔφη· „οὐδεπώποτε γὰρ ἑξηκονταετὴς ἐγένου“.

     \[Demades\], having written an unlawful decree and being censured by Lycurgus, when that man asked him if, when he was writing the decree, he considered the laws, he said, "I did not consider them, for the arms of the Macedonians cast a shadow over them."

236. Ὁ αὐτὸς οὐ θελόντων Ἀθηναίων τιμᾶν Ἀλέξανδρον ὡς θεὸν „δέδια“, φησίν, „\<ὦ\> ἄνδρες, ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, μὴ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ φθονοῦντες Ἀλεξάνδρῳ τὴν γῆν ἀφαιρεθῆτε ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ“.

     \[Demades\], speaking a case once in an inn for someone assaulted, he summoned the innkeepers as witneses, but when the judges said they were not trustworthy, he said, "For the place in which the assalt happened was such as this. But if he had commited assault in the wooden horse, I would be offering to you as witnesses the chiefs Menelaus and Diomedes and Odysseus."

242. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπό τινος τί εἴη πεποιηκὼς τὰ ἐκ Μακεδονίας χρήματα ἀναβαλόμενος καὶ ἐπιδείξας τήν τε κοιλίαν καὶ τὰ αἰδοῖα ἔφη· „τί ἂν τούτοις \<ἱκανὸν γένοιτο\>;“

244. Ὁ αὐτὸς ὀνειδιζόμενος καθ’ ὅτι ἕνα μόνον υἱὸν ἔθρεψεν εἶπεν· „ἕνα κρεῖττόν ἐστι τριηράρχην ἢ δέκα κωπηλάτας καταλιπεῖν.“

     \[Demades\], being reproached because he only raised one son, said, "It is better to leave behind one trierarch rather than ten rowers."

245. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη· „ὥσπερ τὸ τῆς Ἑλένης κάλλος ἐπ’ ἀπωλείᾳ τῶν ἡρώων ἐγένετο, οὕτω καὶ Δημοσθένους ἐν τῷ λέγειν δύναμις ἐπ’ ἀπωλείᾳ τῆς Ἑλλάδος ηὐξήθη“.

     \[Demades\] said, "Just as the beauty of Helen resulted in the destruction of heroes, thus also Demosthenes' strength in speaking grew into the destruction of Greece.

250. Ὁ αὐτὸς τοὺς πλουσίους καὶ ἀπαιδεύτους παραπλησίους ἔφησεν εἶναι τοῖς κριοῖς τοῖς ἐπιπόκοις, πλὴν ὅτι ἐκείνους μὲν οἱ κουρεῖς, τούτους δὲ οἱ συκοφάνται κείρουσιν.

     \[Democrates\] said that the wealthy and the uneducated resemble wooly rams, except that shearers shear those, while sycophants fleece these. 

251. Ὁ αὐτός ποτε ἀποσταλεὶς παρὰ Ἀθηναίων πρὸς Φίλιππον κατὰ πρεσβείαν μετὰ παῤῥησίας αὐτῷ ὡμίλει· τοῦ δὲ Φιλίππου εἰπόντος· „οὐ φοβῇ, μὴ τὴν κεφαλήν σου προστάξω ἀφελεῖν;“ „οὐ φοβοῦμαι“ εἶπεν· „ἐὰν γὰρ σύ μου ταύτην ἀφέλῃς, ἡ πατρίς μοι αὐτὴν ἀθάνατον ἀναθήσει“. 

     \[Democrates\], having been sent once by the Athenians to Philip on an embassy, associated with him frankly. And when Philip said, "Aren't you afraid that I will issue a command to take off your head?", he said, "I am not afraid, for if you take off this one of mine, my fatherland will set it up as immortal."

252. Ὁ αὐτὸς θεωρῶν τοὺς περὶ Ἀριστογείτονα καὶ Πυθέαν πονηροὺς ἀνθρώπους ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου προαγομένους „οὐκ αἰσχύνεσθε,“ φησίν, „ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, καθάπερ οἱ ὄρνιθες τὰ κόπρια εἰς τὸ μέσον ἕλκοντες“;

     Socrates was asked how he thought king Archelaus held himself with respect to happiness, and he said he didn't know: "For I don't know how he holds himself with respect to education."

497. Ὁ αὐτὸς εἶπεν· „εἰ \[ἐν\] τῷ πλουτεῖν τὸ χαίρειν συνῆν, πολλοῦ ἂν ἦν ἄξιον· νῦν δὲ ταῦτα χωρίζεται· ὁ γοῦν Μενέλαος παρὰ τῷ ποιητῇ φησιν· ὣς οὔτοι χαίρων τοῖσδε κτεάτεσσιν ἀνάσσω.“

     \[Socrates\] said: "If happiness resided \[in\] being rich, it would be extremely worthwhile; but for now these things are distinct. Indeed as the poet's Menelaus says: 'I take no joy in ruling these riches.'"

498. Ὁ αὐτὸς καταμαθών τινα τῶν νέων περὶ τῆς κυνηγεσίας σφόδρα ἐσπουδακότα, τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν ὀλιγωροῦντα „πόσου“, ἔφη, „ὦ νεανίσκε, ἔστι κυνηγὸν ἀγαθὸν ὠνήσασθαι;“ τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος ὅτι „χιλίων δραχμῶν“ „ἴσθι τοίνυν“ εἶπε „μὴ πλείονος ἄξιος ἐσόμενος, ἐάν σοι τὰ κατὰ πρόθεσιν \<καλῶς\> ἀποβαίνῃ.“

     \[Socrates\], having learned that one of the youths was very eager for hunting, but neglected everything else, said: "Hey kid, what's a good hunter cost?", and he answered that it was "a thousand drachmae", so \[Socrates\] said: "Now see that you won't be worth more than this, if your plan works out \<well\>."

499. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς διὰ τί συντάγματα οὐ γράφει ἔφη· „ὅτι τὰ ἄγραφα τῶν γεγραμμένων ὁρῶ πλείονος πωλούμενα.“ 

     \[Socrates\] having been asked why he didn't write down his works, said: "Since I see the blank sheets selling for more than those that have been written on."

500. Ὁ αὐτὸς θαυμάσαντός τινος ὅτι λακτισθεὶς ἠνέσχετο ἔφη· „εἰ δὲ ὄνος με ἐλάκτισε, δίκην ἂν αὐτῷ ἔλαχον;“

     \[Socrates\], when someone was marveling that he restrained himself after being kicked, sad: "And if a donkey kicks me, should I file a lawsuit?"

501. Σόλων ὁ σοφὸς ἐρωτῶντος αὐτόν τινος πῶς ἂν μὴ γένοιτο ἀδίκημα εἶπεν· „εἰ ὁμοίως ἀγανακτοῖεν ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀδικήμασιν οἱ μὴ ἀδικούμενοι τοῖς ἀδικουμένοις.“

     Solon the wise man, when someone asked him how wrongs could not happen, said, "If those who are not wronged would be equally vexed as those who are wronged at the wrongs done.

502. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐπιτιμωμένου τινὸς ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῷ κυβεύειν καὶ λέγοντος περὶ μικροῦ παίζειν „ἀλλὰ τό γε ἔθος“ εἶπεν „οὐ μικρὸν \[κακόν\].“

     When someone was rebuked by \[Solon\] for playing at dice and said that he played for a small amount, he said, "But your character, at any rate, is no small thing."

503. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη ἐκείνην ἄριστα διοικεῖσθαι τὴν πόλιν, ἐν ᾗ τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς συμβαίνει τιμᾶσθαι, κάκιστα δὲ οἰκεῖσθαι, ἐν ᾗ τοὺς κακούς.

     \[Solon\] said that that city is managed best in which it happens that the good are honored, but that that one is managed worst in which the bad are.

504. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔγραψεν ἐντὸς πεντήκοντα ἐτῶν γυναῖκα εἰς τὸ δημόσιον μὴ προιέναι· ἐρωτώμενος δὲ „διὰ τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας;“ εἶπεν· „ἵνα μήτις πυνθάνηται, τίνος γυνή, ἀλλὰ τίνος μήτηρ.“

     \[Solon\] wrote for a woman within 50 years not to go into a public building. But when asked, "Why did you do this?" he said, "So that no one would ask, "Whose wife is this?" but rather "Whose mother?"

505. Σόλων ἔλεγε τοὺς παρὰ τοῖς τυράννοις δυναστεύοντας παραπλησίους εἶναι ταῖς ψήφοις ταῖς ἐπὶ τῶν λογισμῶν· καὶ γὰρ ἐκείνων ἑκάστην ποτὲ μὲν πλείω σημαίνειν, ποτὲ δὲ ἐλάττω· καὶ τούτων τοὺς τυράννους ποτὲ μὲν μέγαν ἕκαστον ἄγειν, ποτὲ δὲ ἄτιμον.

     Solon said that those who hold power alongside tyrants are akin to the pebbles used for calculations. For each of them sometimes means more, and sometimes less. And the tyrants treats each of these men sometimes as great, and sometimes as dishonored.

506. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς διὰ τί κατὰ πατροκτόνου νόμον οὐκ ἔθηκεν εἶπε· „διὰ τὸ ἀπελπίσαι.“

     \[Solon\], when he was asked why he did not establish a law against father-killing, said, "Because I hoped it would not happen."

507. Σόλων ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπό τινος τί ἐστι νόμος εἶπε· „τῶν μὲν δειλῶν φόβος, τῶν δὲ τολμηρῶν κόλασις.“

     Solon, having been asked by someone what the law is, said, "A fear, for the cowardly, and a punishment, for the daring."

508. Σόλων ἐπερωτῶν Κροῖσον τί παρὰ τῆς βασιλείας ἔσχε τιμιώτατον, ἐκείνου δὲ εἰπόντος· „τὸ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς μετελθεῖν καὶ φίλους εὐεργετεῖν“ „πόσῳ μᾶλλον“ ἔφη „χαριέστερον \<ἂν\> ἐποίησας, εἰ καὶ τούτους εἰς φιλίαν μετετρόπωσας;“

     When Solon asked Croesus what he considered the most valuable thing from his kingdom and that man said, "To attack my enemies and show kindness to my friends," he said, "How much more pleasant would you have considered it if you had turned these men also towards friendship?"

509. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς διὰ τίνα αἰτίαν οὐ τεκνοποιεῖ ἔφη· „διὰ φιλοτεκνίαν.“

     \[Solon\], having been asked why he did not bear children, said, "Because of my love for children."

510. Σιμωνίδης ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπό τινος ποῖός ἐστιν ἀσφαλέστατος βίος ἔφη· „ὅταν τις οὕτως ζήσῃ, ὥστε μήτε ἐλεεῖσθαι μήτε βασκαίνεσθαι.“

     When Simonides was asked by someone what the safest sort of life was, he said, "Whenever someone lives in such a way that they never feel pity nor envy."

511. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη τὰ πάθη τοῖς ἀνθρώποις μαθήματα εἶναι περὶ τὸν βίον· „πολλοὶ γὰρ οὐ δυνάμενοι τῷ λόγῳ προορᾶν τὸ μέλλον τῷ πάσχειν ᾔσθοντο τὰ πράγματα.“

     \[Simonides\] said that the emotions are lessons for humans about life. "For many, although they are not able through reason to foretell the future, through suffering they understood their circumstances."
 
512. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς εἰ πάντα γηράσκει ἔφη· „\<πάντα\> πλὴν κέρδους ἀπλήστου.“

     \[Simonides\], having been asked if all things grow old, said, "\<Everything\> except the insatiable desire for profit."

513. Ὁ αὐτὸς νεανίσκου τινὸς αὐτὸν παρακαλοῦντος γράψαι ἐγκώμιον αὐτοῦ, χάριν γὰρ αὐτῷ ἕξειν, „δύο μοι“, εἶπεν, „ὦ βέλτιστε, κιβώτια ὑπάρχει· καὶ εἰς μὲν τὸ ἓν τὰς χάριτας ἀποτίθεμαι, εἰς δὲ τὸ ἕτερον ἀργυρίδιον· ὅταν οὖν ἀνοίξω αὐτὰ βουλόμενος χρῆσθαι, τὸ μὲν τοῦ ἀργυρίου πλῆρες εὑρίσκω, τὸ δὲ τῶν χαρίτων κεκενωμένον.“

     \[Simonides\], when some young man asked him to write an encomium of him, for he would consider it a favor for him, he said, "O good man, I have two boxes. And into the one I put favors, and into the other, silver coin. Then whenever I open them wanting to make use of them, I find the one full of silver, and the other empty of any favors."

514. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς πότερος κρείσσων, Ὅμηρος ἢ Ἡσίοδος, εἶπεν· „Ἡσίοδον μὲν αἱ Μοῦσαι, Ὅμηρον δὲ αἱ Χάριτες ἐτέκνωσαν.“

     \[Simonides\], when he was asked who was greater, Homer or Hesiod, said, "The Muses bore Hesiod, the Graces, Homer."

Στίλπων ὁ Μεγαρικὸς φιλόσοφος ἁλούσης αὐτοῦ τῆς πατρίδος ὑπὸ Δημητρίου τοῦ Πολιορκητοῦ καὶ διαρπαγείσης ἀναχθεὶς ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα καὶ ἐρωτώμενος εἴ τι δὴ αὐτὸς ἀπώλεσε „τῶν ἐμῶν μὲν οὐδὲν“ ἔφη· „τὸν γὰρ λόγον καὶ τὴν παιδείαν ἔχω, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ διὰ τί μᾶλλον ἐμὰ ἢ οὐχὶ τῶν πολιορκούντων;“
      
         Stilpo the Megarian philosopher was kicked out of his homeland by Demetrius the taker-of-cities, and having had his things seized and returned to the king and being asked if he had lost anything, said: "Nothing of mine, for I still have speech and an education, and as for the rest why should they really belong to me instead of the taker-of-cities?"
      
      2. \<Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς τῆς πόλεως αὐτοῦ διαρπαζομένης ὑπὸ Δημητρίου· „μὴ καὶ τῶν σῶν, Στίλπων, τὶ ἀφαιρεῖται;“ εἶπεν „οὐδέν· οὐ γὰρ πώ ποτ’ ἐμὰς βοῦς ἤλασαν, οὐδὲ μὲν ἵππους·\> ἄλλως τε οὐδένα στρατιωτῶν ἀρετὴν ἐπ’ ὤμων εἶδον ἐκφέροντα.“
      
         \<\[Stilpo\] having been asked about his city being plundered by Demetrius: "And of your things, Stilpo, what did he take?", said: "Nothing: 'for neither were my cattle ever driven away, nor my horses.'\> I especially didn't see the soldiers carrying out virtue on their shoulders."
      
516. \<Ὁ\> αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς τί ἰσχυρότερόν ἐστιν ἀνδριάντος εἶπεν· „ἄνθρωπος ἀναίσθητος.“

     \[Stilpo\] having been asked what is harder than a statue, said "An unfeeling man."

517. Σοφοκλῆς, ὁ τῶν τραγῳδιῶν ποιητής, ἀκούσας Εὐριπίδην ἐν Μακεδονίᾳ τεθνηκέναι εἶπεν· „ἀπώλετο ἡ τῶν ἐμῶν ποιημάτων ἀκόνη.“

     Sophocles, the poet of tragedies, when he heard that Euripides had died in Macedonia, said, "The whetstone of my poems has died."

     When \[Sophocles\] was asked why he depicted the character of people as good and Euripides as bad, said, "Because I depict men that should exist, and that man depicts those that do.

519. Στρατόνικος ἰδὼν μεγάλα πρόπυλα ἰδιωτικῆς οἰκίας κόψας τὴν θύραν πρὸς τὸν ὑπακούσαντα εἶπεν· „ἔνδον Ἀγαμέμνων;“

     \[Stratonicus\] was spending time with Dionysius the tyrant and was summoned to dinner, where the wine was bad but considered their best, disgusting him; Dionysius heard this and said: "But I got it from Petra!", and \[Stratonicus\] said: "Me, I was completely in doubt, if it even came from a vineyard."

522. Ὁ αὐτὸς καταπαίζων τῆς Θηβαίων πόλεως ἔφησε· „τίς ἂν προνοηθείη τῆς πόλεως ταύτης, ἐν ᾗ τὰ μὲν λάχανα πωλεῖται ὑπὸ στέγην, τὰ δὲ ἄλφιτα ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ;“
