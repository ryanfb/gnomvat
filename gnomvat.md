   \[Antisthenes\] was asked by a tyrant, why the rich don’t seek out the wise, but instead the opposite happens, he said: “The wise know what things they need in life, but the rich do not know, since they consider things better than wisdom.”
   
7. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπό τινος, τί· τὸν υἱὸν διδάξει, εἶπεν· „εἰ μὲν θεοῖς αὐτὸν συμβιοῦν ἐθέλοις, φιλόσοφον· εἰ δὲ ἀνθρώποις, ῥήτορα“.

   \[Antisthenes\] was asked by someone, how the government of a city should be approached, he said: “not too close, so that you won’t get burned, but not too far either, so that you won’t freeze.”

    \[Anacharsis\] was playing knucklebones, and being rebuked on account of his playing, said: “Just as a bow stretched too far breaks, but one relaxed, becomes useful to the matters of life, thus also we should treat the reasoning which remains toiling upon itself.”

    \[Anacharsis\] being reproached by someone, on account of being Scythian, said: “The rose too is grown in thorns, but in pleasure and beauty distinguishes itself.”

    Aristippus the Cyrenian philosopher was shipwrecked sailing into Athens, and having been taken in by the Athenians and asked what he intended after returning to Cyrene to say to his friends back home, said: “to procure the sorts of travel provisions, which will float together with the shipwreck.”

24. Ὁ αὐτὸς παρὰ τῶν μαθητῶν λαμβάνειν ἔφασκε μισθόν, οὐχ ὅπως τὸν βίον ἐπανορθώσῃ, ἀλλ’ ὅπως ἐκεῖνοι μάθωσιν εἰς τὰ καλὰ δαπανᾶν.

    \[Aristippus\] said he took a fee from his students, not to correct their life, but so that they would learn that they can put their money towards fine things.
    
25. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἄσωτον γενόμενον τὸν υἱὸν ἐξέκλεισεν· τῆς δὲ γυναικὸς μεμφομένης, ὅτι αὐτὸν οὐ προσίεται καὶ λεγούσης παρ’ ἕκαστα, ὡς καὶ οὗτος ἐξ αὐτοῦ εἴη, ἀποπτύσας \[ὁ Ἀρίστιππος\] \<ἔφη·\> „καὶ γὰρ καὶ τοῦτο ἐξ ἐμοῦ ἐστιν, ἀλλ’ ἀποῤῥίπτω αὐτό, ὅτι με λυπεῖ“.

    \[Aristippus\] shut out his son because he became profligate. But when his wife reproached him because he did not admit him and  said each time that this man also was from him, Aristippus, spitting, said, "No, for this also is from me, but I get rid of it because it pains me."

26. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτώμενος, τί θαυμαστόν ἐστιν ἐν βίῳ \<εἶπεν\>· „ἄνθρωπος ἐπιεικὴς καὶ μέτριος, ὅτι ἐν πολλοῖς ὑπάρχων μοχθηροῖς οὐ διέστραπται“.

    \[Aristippus\] being asked, what is amazing in life, said: “a person who is fair and moderate, since being among many wretched leaders they were unable to be twisted.”
    
27. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἀνθρώπου αὐτὸν ἀδικήσαντος καὶ περιφεύγοντος καὶ ἀπαντᾶν διατρεπομένου συντυχὼν ἅπαξ εἶπεν· „οὐ σὲ χρὴ ἐμὲ φεύγειν, ἀλλ’ ἐμὲ σὲ ὄντα φαῦλον“. 

    \[Aristippus\] having happened upon a man who was unjust and hiding from him and altogether in the wrong, once said: “You don’t need to hide from me, but me from your being so low.”
    
28. Ὁ αὐτὸς ὀνειδιζόμενος ὑπό τινος, ὅτι Κυρηναῖος ὑπάρχων ἐκ τῆς πατρίδος πεφυγάδευται, „καί“, εἶπε, „νεανίσκε, μεγάλα με ἡ πατρὶς ἠδίκησεν ἐκ τῆς Λιβύης με εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἐκβαλοῦσα“.

    \[Aristippus\] was being being reproached by someone, that the Cyrenian leaders had banished him from their homeland, and said: “Yes, young man! My homeland did a great wrong in casting me out of Libya and into Greece.”
    
29. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφη δεῖν ἐθίζειν ἀπὸ ὀλίγων ζῆν, ἵνα μηδὲν αἰσχρὸν χρημάτων ἕνεκεν πράττωμεν.

    \[Aristippus\] said that it was necessary to be used to living with little, so that we might not do anything shameful on account of money.

30. Ὁ αὐτὸς Πλάτωνος εἰσελθόντος πρὸς αὐτὸν μαλακῶς ἔχοντα καὶ πυθομένου, πῶς διάγει, ἔφη τὸν μὲν σπουδαῖον καὶ πυρέττοντα καλῶς ἔχειν, τὸν δὲ φαῦλον καὶ μὴ πυρέττοντα κακῶς.

    Once, Plato approached \[Aristippus\] when he had a fever and asked, “How are you?”, and he said: “Those who are good and feverish are well, but those who are bad and feverless are ill.”
    
31. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐγκαλοῦντός τινος ἀνθρώπῳ τινί, ὅτι λαβὼν ἀργύριον οὐκ ἀπέδωκε, „σαυτῷ δέ“, φησίν, „οὐκ ἐγκαλεῖς, εἰ μὴ ὀρθῶς ἐδοκίμασας, ᾧ ἐδίδους;“

    \[Aristippus\] on being accused by someone, that he took money and didn’t give it back, said: “Are you not accused by yourself, if you didn’t choose rightly, o giver?”

32. Ὁ αὐτὸς καθόλου τὸ εὔχεσθαι τὰ ἀγαθὰ καὶ ἀπαιτεῖν τι παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἔφη γελοῖον εἶναι· οὐ γὰρ τοὺς ἰατροὺς ὅταν ἄῤῥωστος αἰτῇ τι βρωτὸν ἢ ποτόν, τότε διδόναι, ἀλλ’ ὅταν αὐτοῖς δοκήσῃ συμφέρειν.

    \[Aristippus\] said that to pray for something good and demand it from god is generally laughable; for doctors do not give the sick food or drink whenever they ask for it, but whenever they think it will help them.
    
33. Ὁ αὐτὸς ὁρκίζοντός τινος παῖδα χρηστὸν γενέσθαι καὶ δίκαιον εἰς αὐτὸν εἶπεν· „ὅρκωσον αὐτὸν καὶ γραμματικὸν καὶ μουσικὸν γενέσθαι καὶ ὅρα, εἰ ἔσται μηδὲν μαθὼν τῶν τοιούτων“.

    \[Aristippus\], when an enslaved person was swearing to become good and just, said: "Swear to become a grammarian and musician and see, if you ever learn these things."

34. Ὁ αὐτὸς εἶπεν· „ὥσπερ τὰ σώματα ἡμῶν τρεφόμενα μὲν αὔξεται, γυμναζόμενα δὲ στερεοῦται, οὕτω καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ μελετῶσα μὲν αὔξεται, καρτεροῦσα δὲ βελτίων γίνεται“.

    \[Aristippus\] said: "Just as our bodies are grown by nourishment, but strengthened by exercise, thus also the soul is grown by thinking, but becomes better by patience."

35. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ὑπὸ Διονυσίου τοῦ τυράννου, πότε παύσεται αἰτῶν αὐτόν, „ὅτε“, ἔφη, „καὶ σὺ διδούς· τοῦτο δὲ ἔσται, ὅταν μὴ εὐαρεστήσωμεν ἀλλήλοις“.

    \[Aristippus\] having been asked by the tyrant Dionysius, when he would stop begging, said: "Whenever you also stop giving; but you'll be able to do this, when we're not pleasing to one another."

36. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθείς, τί αὐτῷ περιγέγονεν ἐκ φιλοσοφίας, ἔφη· „τὸ ἀδεῶς τοῖς ἐντυγχάνουσιν ὁμιλεῖν“.

    \[Aristippus\] having been asked, what advantage he'd gained from philosophy, said: "Effortlessly keeping company with anyone I meet."

37. Ὁ αὐτὸς εἰπόντος τινὸς αὐτῷ, διὰ τί τοῖς μοχθηροῖς πλησιάζει, εἶπεν· „ὅτι καὶ ἰατροὶ τοῖς νοσοῦσιν.“

    \[Aristippus\], when someone asked why he associated with bad people, said: "Since doctors also associate with sick people."

38. Ὁ αὐτὸς θεασάμενός τινα ὀργιζόμενον καὶ διὰ τῶν λόγων σφοδρῶς χαλεπαίνοντα ὑποτυχὼν ἔφη· „μὴ τοὺς λόγους δι’ ὀργῆς ἄγωμεν, ἀλλὰ τὴν ὀργὴν διὰ τῶν λόγων καταλύωμεν“.

    \[Aristippus\], seeing someone angry and furious on account of an argument, interrupting him said: "Let us not conduct argument through anger, but instead dissolve anger through argument."

39. Ὁ αὐτὸς οὐκ ὀλίγα χρήματα παρὰ Διονυσίου \[καὶ\] μετὰ τὸν ἀπόπλουν λαβὼν καὶ δι’ αὐτὰ ἐπιβουλεύεσθαι μέλλων ὑπὸ τῶν ναυτῶν, μεταβὰς ἐκ τοῦ μέσου τῆς νηὸς παρ’ ἕνα τοῖχον ἐκέλευσε ἐκκενωθῆναι τὰ ἀγγεῖα ἐπὶ τῶν σανίδων ὡς ἀριθμεῖν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐσπουδακώς, περινεύσας δὲ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸν βυθόν· τῶν δὲ ναυτῶν ἐπὶ τούτῳ δυσφορησάντων εἶπε· "λυσιτελεῖ δι’ ἐμὲ τὸ ἀργύριον ἀπολέσθαι ἢ ἐμὲ δι’ αὐτό."

    \[Aristippus\] had taken a lot of money from Dionysius when sailing back and because of this the sailors were plotting against him, so he moved from the middle of the boat to one side and ordered them to empty the money out onto the benches as though they could immediately count the money, but instead he turned around and threw it into the deep; and with the sailors being furious at this, he said: "Better to lose the money because of me than to lose me because of the money."

40. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐπιλαμβανομένου αὐτοῦ ποτε Πλάτωνος [ἐπὶ] τῶν δώδεκα δραχμῶν πολυτελῆ ἰχθὺν πρίασθαι ἠρώτησεν, εἰ αὐτὸς ἂν δραχμῆς τὸν αὐτὸν ἰχθὺν ὠνήσατο· τοῦ δὲ συνθεμένου ἔφη μηδὲ αὑτῷ πολλοῦ καθεστηκέναι· „ὃ γάρ ἐστι Πλάτωνι ἡ μία δραχμή, τοῦτο Ἀριστίππῳ αἱ δώδεκα.“ 

    When Plato rebuked \[Aristippus\] for trying to buy a fancy fish for 12 drachmae he asked, if \[Plato\] would buy the same fish for a drachma; and when he agreed, \[Aristippus\] said it wouldn't be too great a cost for him, "Since what is one drachma for Plato, is twelve for Aristippus."

41. \[Aristippus\]
42. Ὁ αὐτὸς μεταπεμπομένου πολλάκις αὐτὸν τοῦ πατρός, ὡς οὐχ ὑπήκουσεν γράψαντος, ὅτι πωλήσει αὐτὸν κατὰ τοὺς πατρίους νόμους, ἀντέγραψεν ὀλίγον ἔτι περιμεῖναι χρόνον· καὶ <γὰρ> πλείονος ἄξιον γενόμενον πλείονος πωλήσειν. 

    \[Aristippus\] was being sent for by his father repeatedly, but since he did not obey, his father wrote that he would sell him into slavery in accordance with the parental laws; so Aristippus wrote back to wait a little while longer: for becoming more worthy he would be able to be sold for more.

43. Ὁ αὐτὸς μέλλων ἐντυγχάνειν Φαρναβάζῳ, τῷ βασιλέως σατράπῃ, [καὶ] λέγοντός τινος αὐτῷ· „θάρσει, ὦ Ἀρίστιππε“, ἔφη· „εἴ τι ἕτερον ἔχεις, λέγε· ἐγὼ δὲ, ἐξ οὗ Σωκράτει ὡμίλησα, οὐδενὸς ἀνδρὸς ὁμιλίαν ηὐλαβήθην“.

    \[Aristippus\] was about to meet Pharnabazus, the king's satrap, and someone said to him: "Cheer up, Aristippus!", so he said: "If you have something else to say, say it; for my part, since I've conversed with Socrates, I haven't been wary of conversing with any other man."

44. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἔφησεν· „καὶ εἰ μηδὲν ἄλλο, ἐκ φιλοσοφίας τοῦτό μοι περιγέγονε· τὸ τοῖς προσπίπτουσι κατὰ λόγον ὑπαντᾶν.“

    \[Aristippus\] said: "If nothing else, I've gained this from philosophy: to meet the things that befall me rationally."

45. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐπιλαβομένων αὐτοῦ τῶν πολιτῶν, ὅτι μειρακίοις μᾶλλον συνδιατρίβει διαλεγόμενος αὐτοῖς περὶ φρονήσεως, ἔφη· „καὶ γὰρ ὑμᾶς, ὦ πολῖται, ὁρῶ οὐ τοὺς γέροντας τῶν ἵππων δαμάζοντας, ἀλλὰ τοὺς πώλους.“

    \[Aristippus\] having been rebuked by the populace, that he spent more time talking with youths about wisdom than with them, said: "Because, citizens, I don't see you taming the old horses, but the young ones."

46. Ἄλεξις, ὁ τῶν κωμῳδιῶν ποιητής, ἐπειδή τις αὐτὸν ὄντα πρεσβύτην ἑώρα μόλις πορευόμενον καὶ ἠρώτα· „τί ποιεῖς“; „κατὰ σχολὴν“, φησίν, „ἀποθνήσκω“.

    Alexis, the comic poet, when someone saw him as an old man walking slowly and asked: "What are you doing?", said: "By slowness, dying."

47. Ἀριστείδης ὁ δίκαιος ὀνειδιζόμενός ποτε ἐπὶ πενίᾳ εἶπεν· „ἀλλ’ ἐμοὶ μὲν ἡ πενία οὐδὲν συνιστορεῖ κακόν, σοὶ δὲ ὁ πλοῦτος πολλά“.

    Aristides the Just being reproached when he was in poverty, said: "But my poverty suggests nothing bad, while your wealth suggests much."

    \[Aristides\], hearing that the Athenians had destroyed the statues of him, said: "But not the virtue they erected them on account of."

49. Ἀριστοτέλης ὁ φιλόσοφος ἰδὼν νέον σπουδάζοντα περὶ τὰς θέας, „ὅρα“, εἶπεν, „ὦ νεανίσκε, μὴ σπουδάζων περὶ τὸ θεᾶσθαι ἑτέρους αὐτὸς μηδὲν ἄξιον σχῇς θέας“.

    Aristotle the philosopher, seeing a young man anxious about getting a view, said, "Watch, o young man, lest, while being anxious about viewing others, you yourself have nothing worthy of a view."

    \[Aristotle\], seeing someone grieved at the threats of his father, said, "Do not pay heed to his words, young man, but to his heart."

     When \[Theocritus\] was invited to the symposium of a profligate man who, having sold his own land, had devoured it up, and when that man brought forward boiling food and claimed that he had burnt down the sky, he said, "Well then, if you have devoured up the land and burnt down the sky, the only remaining thing for you is the drink up the sea."

     \[Theocritus\], when the Abderites were deliberating how they would conquer the Thracians, said, "If you elect Charmides the doctor as general, you will command the one who is now serving as general to be a doctor.

344. Ὁ αὐτὸς ἐρωτηθεὶς ποῖα ἂν εἴη θηρία χαλεπώτερα εἶπεν· „ἐν μὲν τοῖς ὄρεσιν ἄρκοι καὶ λέοντες, ἐν δὲ ταῖς πόλεσι τελῶναι καὶ
συκοφάνται“.

     When \[Theocritus\] was washing vegetables, when someone asked him if he knew a certain money-lender, he said, "What are you talking about? Because I am content with such a life?"
